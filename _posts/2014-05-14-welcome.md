## Hello.

This blog is more intended for my own consumption... a place I can add guides and how-to's that I may need to reference in the future.  If this by chance helps somebody out there, then I am happy to pay it forward!

Currently I am knee deep in my side-project of setting up Atlassian JIRA, Agile and Confluence for personal use.  Of course this is leading up to other ideas I have, but since I'm somewhat involved with Atlassian administration (mostly back-end at the moment) in my day job I thought it would be good to set it all up on my own. 

Coming soon... Part 1 of how I set up and configured JIRA using VirtualBox and CentOS on my home workstation.
